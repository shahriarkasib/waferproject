This is and to end machine learning project. In this project I have made a ML model in which the model will predict a wafer as good or bad, based on the data. This is a complete end to end project. I have used aws s3 bucket to store the training the data and other necessary files. Mongodb database has ben used to store the logs and input and prediction data. Also the prediction output is saved in the same database.
